## Vela Pulsar Time-Series Analysis

This project analyses voltage data from the Vela pulsar. The raw voltage signal is converted into a time-series representation and analysed in the frequency domain using Fourier techniques to extract characteristic spectral features.

### Methods
- Construction of time-series data from raw voltage measurements
- Discrete Fourier Transform (FFT)–based spectral analysis
- Identification of dominant frequency components

### Tools
Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

### Output
The full analysis output, including plots and derived quantities, is provided in `pulsar.html`, generated from the analysis pipeline.
